## Introduction
This repository contains a snapshot of the Julia code used to generate computational results presented in the following paper:
> Gupta, R., & Zhang, Q. (2020). Decomposition and Adaptive Sampling for Data-Driven Inverse Linear Optimization. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.07961.

(To be updated to the correct <em>INFORMS Journal of Computing</em> reference)

A preprint of this paper is also available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07961) and our research group's [website](https://qizh.cems.umn.edu/publications/journal-articles).

The code in this repository here requires the following software:
1. [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/)
2. [BARON](https://minlp.com/baron-solver)
3. [Julia](https://julialang.org/) with the following packages:
    - JuMP
    - Gurobi
    - Linear Algebra
    - CSV
    - DataFrames
    - Printf
    - BARON

Details of the specific versions of these softwares used for provided here can be found in Section 6 of the paper.

Next, we provide the steps that one needs to follow to reproduce our results.
